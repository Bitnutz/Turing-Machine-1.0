# Turing Machine Project
## A non-deterministic of a Turing Machine using a set of rules and an input, passed by the user.

# **Structure and classes**

# 1. Tokenizer
## The tokenizer is responisble for parsing the given input(rules and input tape) into tokens and distribute them into structures respectively.

# 2. Graph
## The graph class represents the rules linked between each other with their respective edges. An example for such a graph is the following: 
![Instruction Graph sample](https://github.com/Bitnutz/Turing-Machine-1.0/blob/main/sampleGraph.png)

# 3. Tape
## The tape class represents the tape of the machine. Two stacks are used, the left hadn-side is storing the symbols on the left of the tape,while the right hand-side is storing the the head and the symbols to the right.

# 4. Machine
## This class is the main engine of the project, using all of the above classes.

# Sample program for maiking all 0s and 1s Xs. (The sample is the same as the image above)
